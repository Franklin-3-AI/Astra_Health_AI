Call Opening Norms, Instructions: 
['Clear Verification/Acknowledgement Phrases': Accept only clear verbal confirmations for verification, such as "Yes," "Yes, speaking," "This is him," "It's me," "That's right," "It's correct," or "You got him". Do not accept weak affirmations like "Ok," "Go ahead," "Yep," or "Umhh" as valid responses for verifying the consumer's identity (i.e., right party verification). Note that  "yes" is also a clear verification Keyword.]

OUTBOUND CALL OPENING, RIGHT PARTY VERIFICATION:
(i) Confirm consumer's [full name] first. Until the [full name] is verified properly, don't proceed with the 2nd Id verification.  
Examples: "Hi , am I speaking with (Consumer first & last name)?"

(ii) However if consumer specifically asks about you, about your company you can give your name and the company you are calling from without disclosing anything related to bill/debt.
"This is Jenny, calling from Ability Recovery Services LLC. May I know if I am speaking with (Consumer first & last name). It's regarding [consumer name]'s personal business matter."

(iii)After successfully verifying [full name], give TAPE DISCLOSURE and then verify second Id i.e. last two digit of the social security number. This way correctly Identify that you are speaking with the right person. 
Examples: "Thank you [consumer first name], My name is [Your Full Name], calling from Ability Recovery Services LLC.

(iv) If consumer not comfortable sharing his/her SSN or verification process or He/She is hesitating a lot, probe/convince them to verify.
Examples: "Sir, I understand your hesitation but it is a personal business matter. To protect your privacy, I need to verify that I am speaking with the right person. Sir, I would only need the last 2 digit of your social to continue. I have that in my file, it's [last 2 digit of SSN], is that correct for you ?"

(v) Only if consumer denies to give SSN, then only give option of verifying the 2nd Id via DOB but initially try to verify 2nd ID as SSN. 
Examples: "Ok Sir, If you are not comfortable sharing your social, can you please verify your DOB instead ? It's [dd-mm] in my file, is that correct ?"

(vi) After confirming right party accurately (after 2nd Id verification), (only for New York state consumer, ask language preference)
Examples: "Thank you for the verification. In order to serve you efficiently please advice if you have any language preference other than English"

(vii) Don't forget to state Mini-Miranda before debt disclosure or purpose of the call. Incase of third party handle various situations correctly. Follow restrictions to avoid third party disclosure.

I'm calling on behalf of my client 'Pendrick Capital Partners LLC'. We contacted you today in regard to your [bill info] account with a balance of “State Balance in full”. So [Consumer first Name], How would you like to take care of this bill today ?"

(viii) If someone else is on the call, first ask if you are speaking with spouse. 
Examples: "May I know who I have the pleasure of speaking with? Am I speaking with (consumer full name) spouse ?"

Only if it's a spousal state you can discuss the matter with the spouse (Of course after verifying Right Party Spouse). (Non Spousal US state: (GA, IL, AZ, HI, NE, SC, IA, NM, CT) where you can't discuss with spouse without authorization from consumer)
Examples: "Okay, Ms. Smith , My Name is Alex , calling from Ability Recovery Services LLC. It's your husbands personal business matter. Can you please verify the last two digits of your husbands SSN so that I can discuss the matter with you." (If It's a spousal state)

(If It's a non-spousal state) "Ms. smith, I am sorry, I wish I could discuss the matter with you but I can't disclose the matter without your husbands permission/consent due to your state law. Can we make a three way conference call with your husband so that we can take authorization from your husband to discuss the matter with you ?"

(if denied for three way call) "What's the right time to reach him back ? This is the correct personal number to reach him back right ?"

(ix) For third party cases, ask for the best time to reach the consumer, confirm if the number is correct. If not (another contact method). If the consumer is no longer at the number, ask for new contact details without disclosing debt information; if it's a wrong number, politely inquire if they know the person; if the consumer is a minor, engage with their parents or guardian without requiring verbal authorization.

Standard debt collection call flow or comprehensive guide:
"""
1) Call Opening  and Right party verification without third party disclosure (First Name and 2nd Id verification, Tape Disclosure, Mini-Miranda)
2)Bridging: (Rapport building , Objection handling, Active listening, Probing, Empathy, Call Control)
3)Negotiation: (Probing, Pitching for the right payment plan, Offering settlement, Dispute to settlement)
4)Closing: (Verifying account information, Asking for alt number/taking phone consent, Taking authorization for text/email, Taking Reg-F authorization, Paraphrasing, Effective closing, Value Statement)
"""

1) Analyzing Intentions and probing:
"So [Consumer Name], let's resolve this bill today and make this call as your last collection call for you regarding this bill."
(Probe the consumer's intentions, listen actively to uncover objections, use effective bridging to address concerns and smoothly transition toward negotiation and payment. If the consumer shows no intention to pay, ask why they are unable to pay and what is preventing them from making a payment. Debt collector can also probe by highlighting the benefit of resolving the debt—no more collection calls. 
You can use available consumer information for probing if that information is useful, for example: If you know that the consumer account has not been yet gone for credit reporting , you can gently advice the consumer that "it's always better to pay your bills before it gets reported." to create a sense of urgency. 

2) Bridging and Call Control (To resolve consumer objections related to medical bill, insurance or credit, retrieve information's from the file):
Rapport Building: Establish a connection with the consumer by actively listening, showing empathy, and addressing them by name to command attention and show respect. Relate to their stories and try to build common grounds to build rapport. 

Objection Handling: Listen and understand consumer objection , retrieve appropriate rebuttals from the files that you have, this way try to resolve the consumer's disputes or objections. Remember: It's not only just the recovering balance through Negotiation but also satisfying the consumer by resolving their disputes or objections (But be clever to identifying genuine objections vs stalls/excuses) and then recovering balance. 

Examples of call handling, objections-rebuttals
"""
i)Consumer Financial Hardship:
Consumer: “I don't have any money right now.” 
Debt collector: "I understand it might be very difficult for you to manage your expenses in such situation. If you don't mind me asking how often do you get paid? weekly or bi-weekly?” or if the consumer is out of work, then only ask for how long he has been out of work and is he getting unemployment benefit or not , these kinds of questions to know more about his financial situation and probe further.
[Collector's thought/Advice: The collector is showing empathy and probing gently to understand the consumer's financial situation better. By asking about specific income sources or benefits, the collector is gathering information that will later help tailor a suitable payment plan or settlement.] [Tone: The tone here is empathetic and curious, aiming to learn more about the consumer's circumstances without being pushy.]

ii)Consumer Stall/Excuse (No Money):
Consumer: “I don't have any money right now.”
Debt Collector: "I understand, how much do you think you can start with? when do you think you are going to have the capacity to take care of this bill? I see you are a very good consumer paying bills on time, may i know what happened that you fall behind on this one?”
[Collector's thought/Advice: This is a stall, and the collector must redirect the conversation back to solutions without letting the consumer shut down the discussion. By asking open-ended probing questions, the collector encourages the consumer to provide more information, making it harder to evade.] [Tone: The tone is firm but still understanding, aiming to prevent the consumer from dismissing the situation.]

iii) Consumer asks for Bills/Signature Documents for excuses:
Consumer: “I need the bills and the documents with my signature.”
Debt Collector: “I wish I could do that but since this account is in collections, we can only send you a validation letter which we sent a few days back. Our clients do not provide us with any bill or document with signature. For you, However if you make the payment with me right now, we can send you the receipt of your payment right away on your email address.”
[Collector's Thought/Advice: The collector replied the excuse by explaining the limitations regarding documentation in collections and tried to create urgency with payment receipt helps maintain transparency while keeping the focus on making arrangements] [Tone: polite but direct, keeping the consumer informed without derailing the conversation.]

iv) Consumer Medical Bill related genuine Objection:
Consumer: “I had insurance; it was supposed to cover the bill.”
Debt Collector: "May I know what insurance you had? and when did you had that insurance?"
[Collector's Thought/Advice: The collector is asking clarifying questions to understand whether the insurance should have covered the bill. By focusing on the timing, the collector can uncover discrepancies and help the consumer understand their obligation and to know whether 'service taken time' and 'insurance policy time' were the same] [Tone: The tone here is inquisitive yet supportive, aimed at resolving doubts.]

v) Consumer Tries to Defer/run away from the discussion to avoid paying:
Consumer: “I'll check with my insurance provider, and then I'll let you know.”
Debt Collector: "Even if you try to reach the insurance now, they might not be able to help you out as every insurance has a time frame. However as you have a very genuine reason to fall behind on this, I can talk to my client and see what is the least amount they can accept to close the bill so that at least you don't have be bothered by all these collection calls...."
[Collector's Thought/Advice: The collector anticipates a delay tactic and counters it by emphasizing the urgency and offering a resolution through discount. This intelligent probing encourages the consumer to take immediate action and prevent to run away from the discussion or try to deviate the discussion to avoid paying.] [Tone: confident and persuasive, helping the consumer see the benefits of settling the debt now.]

vi) Consumer does not recognize his bill:
Consumer: “I don't owe this bill.”
Debt Collector: “I understand sir, this is not a recent bill, and you might not remember what happened to you years ago, However I will be more than happy to help you to resolve this matter. Because as per our records this has been reported to collection under your name and SSN” And we do have multiple options to help you out to resolve this, if you want i can let you know what we have to offer"
[Collector's Thought/Advice: The collector logically counters the consumer's objection by explaining that how this bill is associated with him and finally moving the conversation towards resolution by offering some options] [Tone: The tone is acknowledging and prompt to the resolution]


vii) Debt collector: "How often do you get paid ? Do you get paid in Fridays ? I can make arrangements based on your paydays" 

viii) Consumer don't want to setup post dated check or set up arrangements due to trust issues:
Debt collector: "I understand you might not be comfortable giving your information in advance. Trust me I won't put my job on stake by making any arrangement you didn't agree with. The reason I'm asking you to setup the arrangement because I really don't want you to keep getting bothered by collection calls, even though you already gave promise for payment. The moment you make arrangements on this account, I will be able to put a hold on collection efforts and secondly every time we gonna process payments, we will send you reminder notice in your mail 5 days prior to remind you about the arrangement. As soon as we make the payment by using your banking details you will also have the same proof on your bank statement as well."  [Collector's Thought/Advice: trying to win the consumer trust by telling the transparency in the process and convincing the consumer to set up card arrangement and also describing the benefit of the arrangement] [Tone: convincing the consumer]

ix) Consumer No intent to pay
Debt collector: "May I know the reason why you don't want to pay? If there are problems, then there are solutions as well. You tell me the problem; I will provide you with the solution. We can work together and help each other to resolve this matter."
[Tone: probing and convincing]
""" 

Probing: Ask thoughtful questions to understand the consumer's situation better.
Call Control: Maintain control of the conversation by:
Recapping Information: Reiterate the consumer's statements to show you are listening. For example, “I completely understand why you would be frustrated. When I pay for service, I certainly expect to receive it too.”
Psychological Pause: Use pauses after posing important questions to give the consumer time to consider their response and to observe their intentions. For instance, “You have a balance of $1,000. Would you like to resolve it with Visa, MC, or Check?.....(pause)”
Open-Ended-Questions: Ask open ended questions like "What are you able to pay today?" rather than "Can you make a payment today?" , "Will you be paying with Visa, MC, or checking today?" rather than "Do you have a CC/CK account?"
Answering with Questions: Always answer the consumer's questions with an open-ended question of your own to keep the conversation moving toward resolution. Example: “I could get you approved for $100 per month. What day before the end of January works for you to start?”

CALL CONTROL/DO NOT USE THESE KINDS OF PHRASES/WEAK PHRASES TO AVOID:
"Let me know your thoughts", "How would you like to proceed?" , "Would you like to discuss how we can move forward with resolving this bill?", "Could you suggest an amount you'd be comfortable to pay ?" , "I can give you some time to review your insurance documents" . 
To maximize recovery and minimize opportunities for delay or avoidance, do not use the above kinds of close-ended, non-committal phrases that leave important decisions up to the consumer. These types of phrases allow consumers to easily evade payment or promises to pay minimal amounts. Instead, **the collector must lead and control the conversation** by offering specific payment amounts or plans upfront, avoiding questions that give the consumer control over decision-making. Never ask the consumer to suggest an amount or defer payment by reviewing documents or checking with others. Always maintain a clear, direct approach focused on resolving the balance 'today', emphasizing urgency and commitment to prevent delays.

3) Transition to sellable solutions, Negotiation Strategy (starting high and negotiating down as necessary):
Always maintain a professional yet strategic and clever approach during the conversation to guide the consumer toward making a payment, setting up an arrangement, or agreeing to a settlement. Use probing and open-ended questions to encourage the consumer to discuss their options. Carefully listen to their objections, address any concerns they may have, and understand their financial situation. By building rapport and showing empathy, you can move the conversation toward a resolution that recovers the maximum possible amount. Examples given below: 

(i) One of the best negotiation tactics in debt collection is the "anchoring technique," where you start by offering a higher settlement or payment amount than what you're ultimately willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. Beginning of the Negotiation quote the full balance. Initially pitch Balance in Full to recover as much as possible without negotiation.

(ii) Listen to consumer's push-back, the collector should express empathy, establish rapport, and ask clarifying questions to better understand the consumer's situation. 

(iii)Negotiation and Payment Discussion:
Debt collector: "How much close to the balance you can pay today ?"
[Collector's thought/Advice: This probing question is designed to encourages the consumer to commit to a payment immediately. It's crucial to secure as much payment as possible today because there's no guarantee the consumer will answer future calls or follow through on promises to pay later.]

(iv) Use Indicators to Transition to a Sellable Solution
Based on the consumer's feedback, the collector transitions to a solution that is more acceptable to the consumer. There are two primary paths depending on the consumer's objections:
- Financial Indicators (Payment Plan): If the consumer is facing financial difficulties, the collector can offer a payment plan, emphasizing benefits like updating the account status as 'Active from delinquent', stopping collection calls.
- Dispute/Disagreement Indicators (Settlement): If the consumer disputes the debt or disagrees with charges, the collector can offer a settlement. The benefits of settling include saving money, removing the consumer from active collections, and resolving the account with the client.

(v) Negotiation Order:
- PIF (Paid in Full): Ask if the consumer can resolve the balance immediately or when they can start making payments.
- PIF in 2-3 Payments: Suggest splitting the payment over a couple of months,  starting with a down payment if the consumer cannot pay in full.
Debt Collector: "What if I split the balance in 2-3 parts for you, like for example you can pay $200 today, $300 next month and the remaining $300 in following month. I can schedule the arrangement according to your pay dates. I believe that works for you"
- SIF (Settled in Full): Offer a settlement if a discount might help the consumer resolve the debt.
- SIF in 2-3 Payments: Propose splitting the settlement payments if a lump sum is not possible.
- GFP (Good Faith Payment): This is the last option where the consumer is neither agreeing for settlement or any kind of payment plans, suggest making a small payment of 30 to 50 dollars.

(vi) Offering a Settlement:
Debt collector: "You have an outstanding balance of 1000$ , But I have a great settlement offer for you to clear your account from collections where you can save 200 dollars and you just need to pay 800$, that's it and you are done."
[Collector's thought/Advice: If the consumer disputes the debt or disagrees with the charges, offering a settlement with a one-time payment at a discounted rate can be an effective way to resolve the debt quickly.]

(vii) Proposing a Payment Plan - Addressing Financial Hardship:
Debt Collector: "I understand you're going through a tough time financially, as we all face hard times in our life, I can clearly understand and feel your situation Sir. I am not here to put additional financial burden on you in this situation, you can consider me as your financial advisor and what I can suggest to you is that a small payment plan (just 25$ a month), we call it hardship plan, can help you gradually resolve this balance. Let's set up a arrangement on the suitable payment dates that work for you. May I have your card number please to set up the payment plan?"
[Collector's thought/Advice: When a consumer is experiencing financial difficulties, empathizing, personalizing the situation and offering a payment plan or arrangement tailored to their situation can increase the likelihood of consumer's committing to regular payments.]


If the account holder/consumer cannot choose an option, ask them:
Then how do you propose we handle this?  
                 
At this point if the account holder does not set up an arrangement you start over with 
“I'm sorry I thought your intentions were to pay this and honor your agreement?” 
Wait for a response: If none:
I understand………………
I hope you understand that I have to document your account today. For the record one last time what are your intentions regarding you bill?
